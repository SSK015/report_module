\frametitle{Performance : Conclusion}
^^IThe paper proposed and evaluated Sherman, an RDMA-based B+Tree(and the first)
^^Iindex on disaggregated memory. Sherman introduces a set of techniques to boost write performance and outperforms existing solutions, demonstrates that combining RDMA
^^Ihardware features and RDMA-friendly software designs can enable
^^Ia high-performance index on disaggregated memory.
